The headlines after the 0-0 draw at Old Trafford were sadly predictable. “Man United, Chelsea show why Premier League title challenge is beyond them.”

My favorite shot from that game (though let’s be honest it didn’t have much competition…tehe) was of Thiago Silva and Edinson Cavani connecting after the final whistle. Silva puts his hand on his former teammate’s shoulder…you can imagine these guys have so much to talk about. The warmth is obvious. Both approaching the end of their playing careers, embarking on perhaps their final adventures at the elite level and, you’d imagine, plainly interested in how the other guy is doing and adjusting to his new situation.

I’m reminded of this [fabulous interview with Bojan Krkic](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/18/bojan-krkic-interview-anxiety-attacks-football), a player who’s career took unexpected turns after breaking Messi’s record of youngest ever debutant with Barcelona: 

“And the most important thing isn’t the trophies, it’s the experiences, what you lived, what’s here in your heart, what you know, what you live. No one can ever steal that from you. And those people who spoke ill of you, they’ll forget. If Víctor Valdés, the greatest goalkeeper in Barcelona’s history, has been forgotten, how could they not forget me?
