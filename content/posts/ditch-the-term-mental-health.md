Forget fighting uphill to remove the stigma around ‘mental health.’ Instead, let’s upgrade the rhetoric we use to describe the underlying stuff we’re talking about. The very concept of ‘mental health’ perpetuates both the stigma and the apparent illnesses its proponents aim to combat.

Let’s replace it with more poetic terms that reflect the nobility and grandeur of the effort to _fully live_. Unhealthiness seems yucky. 

“I aim to thrive and more fully experience what life has to offer” beats “I’m working on my mental health.” 

I find the first statement much more inspiring, and ultimately more accurate. As if you just worked on your mental health, as if it were a discrete part of your life, and then went back to your life as normal. No! What we’re talking about is our entire experience of life itself. 

To some extent we already do this when we (don't) speak of “physical health.” While a sense that something is ‘wrong’ may provide an initial impetus to start working out, those who stick with it are motivated by something more than ‘healing.’ They get focused on adding weight to the bar every week, adding mileage in preparation for a race, or simply playing.

“I’m training to \[fill in your preferred activity\]” & “I’m going to play \[fill in your favorite game\]” beat “I’m trying to improve my physical health.” 

You’d probably feel a bit excited (and maybe inspired to start training for something yourself!) on behalf of someone who begins training for a marathon.

You’d immediately feel concerned and a bit sorry for the person ‘improving their physical health.’ Not only because it means something’s wrong with them, but also because ‘improving physical health’ sounds like a real drag. Maybe that person would be better off without your pity.

\[Some other stuff I want to address here...the "therapeutic mindset." The modern world is alienating! It's not that there's anything wrong with you.\]
