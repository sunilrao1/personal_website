A recent study suggests that NYC [needs to build 560k additional units overall by 2030](https://commercialobserver.com/2022/01/rebny-calls-on-ny-governor-hochul-to-help-deliver-560k-new-housing-units-by-2030/).

Since the NYC's government publicly tracks only the number of *affordable* housing units getting built, [I've started a tracker](https://airtable.com/shrXwXYUtD75E1qiC) that compiles *all* active and potential legislative initiatives that could yield more housing in order to establish a concrete sense of our current trajectory, and make clear if and how that is insufficient.

Note that the 560 units target should probably be considered a bare minimum. This is what it would take to bring our housing shortage back to 2010 levels, and would not solve it completely.
