What’s the deal with that attractive building by 14th street WeWork…how did it get built? Who were the developers? Is there a story? Pick my five favorite buildings (sacred by both usefulness, size, beauty) in NYC, and do these investigations.

Average professional childcare and/or senior-care caregiver commute?

Average wage for childcare and/or senior-care caregivers in NYC?

What are the most important unfilled jobs in NYC city government?

How many new units would be need to build before rent prices fell?

Say you live in a midtown or FiDi skyscraper…and someone wants to build another skyscraper in your line of site, potentially obstructing your view…how in practice do you respond, what recourse do you have? (Descriptive, not normative.)
