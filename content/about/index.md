Starting small, at last. Building tools for learning better. Proprietor of Rao Athletic Club. Reading and writing widely.

Previously, Iâ€™ve worked in strategic planning at Verizon, done sales and digital marketing at a fintech startup, tried (and failed spectacularly at) finding endorsement deals for Brazilian soccer players, and worked in investment banking at Morgan Stanley.
