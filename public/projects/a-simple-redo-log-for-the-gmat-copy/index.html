	<p>One of my teachers during freshman year of high school encouraged us to write down at the end of each day what we&rsquo;d learned that day, as a way to internalize new concepts.</p>
<p>It was a nice idea. Wish I could say I followed through!</p>
<p>Fast forward twelve (!!) years later, and my GMAT instructor emphasizes that keeping an error log and redoing problems is <a href="https://www.manhattanprep.com/gmat/blog/error-log-the-1-way-to-raise-your-gmat-score/">the #1 way to raise your GMAT Score.</a></p>
<p>This time around, I listened up. In hindsight, I probably could have done an even better job committing to my redo&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Problems would pile up on the error log. I would set up an initial redo date, but soon after, redo&rsquo;s fell by the wayside. Who wants to play with old toys when you get new toys every week? Redo&rsquo;s were too easy to put off.</p>
<p>So, I made a simple tool to help you make sure you actually redo the necessary problems, when you&rsquo;re supposed to do them. Think of it as an accountability system for <em>actually learning</em>. The redoâ€™s are scheduled for you, based on the date of your initial attempts at questions. And if you don&rsquo;t do them, an ugly, red empty checkbox will stare at you every time you begin GMAT studies. YOU SHALL NOT PASS.</p>
<p>Think how much more powerful our learning investments (as both educators and learners) might be if we really devoted the necessary energy to actively recalling new material in subsequent weeks?</p>
