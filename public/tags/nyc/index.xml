      <description>A recent study suggests that NYC needs to build 560k additional units overall by 2030.
Since the NYC&amp;rsquo;s government publicly tracks only the number of affordable housing units getting built, I&amp;rsquo;ve started a tracker that compiles all active and potential legislative initiatives that could yield more housing in order to establish a concrete sense of our current trajectory, and make clear if and how that is insufficient.
Note that the 560 units target should probably be considered a bare minimum.</description>

      <description>What are physical education requirements in NYC public schools. If I were designing PE-reqs for kids with physical autonomy + lifelong health in mind, what would they be?
School meals…everything you didn’t know you wanted to know. How did we come up with dietary requirements/specifications? What does these currently solve for? Where does the food come from?
Create a map of every private and public pull up bar in NYC. Peak hours of use?</description>
