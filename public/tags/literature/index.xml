      <description>I felt like reading a Great Book, and wanted to refresh myself ahead of reading and watching Tom Stoppard&amp;rsquo;s Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead. Hence, The Tragical History of Hamlet Prince of Denmark. The play is about a young man navigating - perhaps better put, failing to navigate - life now that his world has been turned upside down and the band-aid of youth and innocence has been ripped off, following his fatherâ€™s untimely death.</description>
