      <description>As an avid sports fan/weekend warrior, I hate to see sports readily dismissed in Serious Talk about what can make for meaning, stronger communities and a stronger country.
One reason, as Helen Toner mentions, is that Serious Intellectuals don’t take sports seriously.
I think another reason sports don’t figure prominently into 21st century meaning-making is that major sports are very “top-down.” They’re not very friendly to individual meaning-making or even local community identity.</description>
