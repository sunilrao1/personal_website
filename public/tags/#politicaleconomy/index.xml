      <description>Summary The government bailed out debt-holders in a series of bank failures in the 70&amp;rsquo;s through the 90&amp;rsquo;s, signaling an implicit guarantee of creditors. This implicit guarantee combined with a politician-driven effort starting in the 90â€™s to orchestrate an increase in homeownership led to excessive use of leverage by Wall Street and aspiring homeowners to finance increasingly risky investments in housing in the 00&amp;rsquo;s. This in turn allowed Wall Street and politicians to privatize gains ($$, votes) and socialize eventual losses to taxpayers. The use of excessive leverage turns a failure into a meltdown. Rescues distort the natural feedback loop of capitalism.</description>
