      <description>One of my teachers during freshman year of high school encouraged us to write down at the end of each day what we&amp;rsquo;d learned that day, as a way to internalize new concepts.
It was a nice idea. Wish I could say I followed through!
Fast forward twelve (!!) years later, and my GMAT instructor emphasizes that keeping an error log and redoing problems is the #1 way to raise your GMAT Score.
This time around, I listened up. In hindsight, I probably could have done an even better job committing to my redo&amp;rsquo;s.
Problems would pile up on the error log.</description>
