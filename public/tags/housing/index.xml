      <description>A recent study suggests that NYC needs to build 560k additional units overall by 2030.
Since the NYC&amp;rsquo;s government publicly tracks only the number of affordable housing units getting built, I&amp;rsquo;ve started a tracker that compiles all active and potential legislative initiatives that could yield more housing in order to establish a concrete sense of our current trajectory, and make clear if and how that is insufficient.
Note that the 560 units target should probably be considered a bare minimum.</description>
