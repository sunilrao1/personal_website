      <description>I think there are a four sub-areas under the umbrella of no-code:
1. App-builders for wantrapreneurs. While there are some questions around how scalable these platforms are, for founders trying to find PMF, no-code is right now a much more resourceful/efficient approach than teaching yourself to code or hiring a developer. Even coders will use these as a faster way to test an idea.
A couple of fast-growing startups here are Bubble (a full-stack no-code dev platform that I used for my EdTech app) and Webflow (loved by designers).</description>

      <description>If you are a new no-code maker - which was me at the start of ODNC1 - this is for you! As Anthony Constantino reminded me, it can be very helpful to learn from those who are just a step or two ahead of you in the process, moreso than more than advanced practitioners. So hopefully my reflections will be useful to you.
On the creative process Thereâ€™s a lot of great guidance and playbooks on creating software products out there.</description>
