      <description>If you are a new no-code maker - which was me at the start of ODNC1 - this is for you! As Anthony Constantino reminded me, it can be very helpful to learn from those who are just a step or two ahead of you in the process, moreso than more than advanced practitioners. So hopefully my reflections will be useful to you.
On the creative process Thereâ€™s a lot of great guidance and playbooks on creating software products out there.</description>
