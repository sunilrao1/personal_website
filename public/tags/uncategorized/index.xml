      <description>&amp;hellip;the Greco-Roman world, centered on the Mediterranean, of the 8th century BC and the 6th century AD. Why is the classical antiquity period significant?
Western civilization - modernity - was born of a mix of the classical and the Christian. And the recent history of the world - for the last several hundred years, until recently - has been the history of westernization or modernization of the whole world: scientific ideas/methods, new ways of thinking, military technology, and public administration fueling greater power and wealth.</description>

      <description>The Myth of Capitalism, by Jonathan Tepper In summary: Current, unacceptable levels of inequality stem from the deterioration of antitrust enforcement and the subsequent “toll road-ization” of the American economy. Mergers permitted without scrutiny, oligopoly proliferates; workers, customers, suppliers get squeezed. This deterioration was driven by revolving doors, cronyism, and Chicago economic philosophy. This is all exacerbated by concentrated ownership of these toll roads by the wealthy.
Questions &amp;amp; Review Tepper&amp;rsquo;s story is enticingly simple.</description>

      <title>Tools for thought = mental bureaucracy?</title>

      <description>*This is a hot take, quite happy to be disagreed with and told why I&amp;rsquo;m wrong*
I think focusing on using tools for thought can easily turn into the construction of a suffocating educational bureaucracy. It’s utopian high-modernism applied to independent learning.
What if it’s better to just learn things that really makes us burn with curiosity and desire, that make us want to keep building on that foundation and go deeper.</description>

      <title>Toni Morrison’s &#34;Sula&#34; &amp; playing with meaning</title>

      <description>This was my first Toni Morrison book, and it was magnificent. It is clear as you read it that a master is at work. You feel you are in the palm of her hand, and you like it that way.
Horrifying and painful yet life-affirming all at once. Dramatic but in a playful, deft way. Compassionate but not pitying. Pensive but not preachy or judgmental. Especially on this last note - this novel brought back to mind David Chapman’s schematic of predominant stances toward meaning.</description>
