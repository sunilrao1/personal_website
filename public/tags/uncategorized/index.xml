      <title>Hopelessly half-baked study guide #3: The Kegan Model</title>

      <description>Several friends and mentors of mine have suffered the misfortune of lending me their ears during my Kegan phase. For the uninitiated, Robert Kegan has proposed a fascinating and encouraging model of psychological development that continues well into adulthood - which, one learns, was not previously generally accepted. This is sort of a cheat-post - I repurpose what I wrote from an email exchange my attempt (only what I wrote) to put Kegan’s work in my words and reflect on it’s applicability, lightly edited for clarity. My main sources were Kegan’s In Over Our Heads: The Mental Demands of Modern Life, and of course David Chapman’s piece on the Kegan model, which provides a much better and deeper summary.</description>

      <title>“How to Do What You Love” needs a prequel</title>

      <description>“To do something well you have to like it,” Paul Graham famously wrote. This advice can come like a friendly slap in the face. Of course! Striving to excel in a domain that does not interest us is obviously silly. But are we capable of liking something long enough - and without grasping at it and suffocating it - to do it well?
Some thoughts from others:
Andrew Yang: “They need status and reassurance…They think in two years, not 20. …They get agitated if they’re not making clear progress…They fear being wrong and looking silly…They talk themselves out of having guts&amp;hellip;They worry too much.</description>

Nice read!
#### [sunilrao93](http://sunilrao93.wordpress.com &#34;sunil.rao.93@gmail.com&#34;) - Oct 3, 2020 Thanks Jordan! Saw you mention The Master and Margarita on your site. That&amp;rsquo;s on my reading list as well, looking forward to reading your take on it!
#### [jordanreads](http://jordanbrunelbloghome.wordpress.com &#34;jordan.brunel@aol.com&#34;) - Oct 4, 2020 The Master and Margarita is excellent - magic realism&amp;rsquo;s indebtedness to Bulgakov is really apparent after reading it!</description>

      <description>&amp;hellip;the Greco-Roman world, centered on the Mediterranean, of the 8th century BC and the 6th century AD. Why is the classical antiquity period significant?
Western civilization - modernity - was born of a mix of the classical and the Christian. And the recent history of the world - for the last several hundred years, until recently - has been the history of westernization or modernization of the whole world: scientific ideas/methods, new ways of thinking, military technology, and public administration fueling greater power and wealth. Previous ancient civilizations did some science for very practical purposes, but on the whole relied upon myths and superstitions to “understand” the world.</description>

      <title>Hopelessly half-baked study guide #1: takeaways from “Political Economy 101”</title>
      <link>https://relaxed-wilson-de5218.netlify.app/post/takeaways-from-political-economy-101/</link>

      <description>A few months ago, I set out to give myself an introduction to “something like” political economy. It was a conveniently vague way to assemble a reading plan around some things I’d been wanting to read for a while at the intersection of philosophy, economics, history and technology.
Though a bit scattered, doing this surfaced a few distinct topics and questions for me to pursue in future:
1. Epistemology, or the “theory of knowledge.” “…reputed to be the most abstract and remote and altogether irrelevant region of pure philosophy. Hume, for example, one of the greatest thinkers in [epistemology] predicted that, because of the remoteness and abstractness and practical irrelevance of some of his results, none of his readers would believe in them for more than an hour,” said Karl Popper.</description>

      <title>The link between antitrust and inequality</title>

      <description>The Myth of Capitalism, by Jonathan Tepper In summary: Current, unacceptable levels of inequality stem from the deterioration of antitrust enforcement and the subsequent “toll road-ization” of the American economy. Mergers permitted without scrutiny, oligopoly proliferates; workers, customers, suppliers get squeezed. This deterioration was driven by revolving doors, cronyism, and Chicago economic philosophy. This is all exacerbated by concentrated ownership of these toll roads by the wealthy.
Questions &amp;amp; Review Tepper&amp;rsquo;s story is enticingly simple. Basically, we just need to restore antitrust enforcement. It is hard to disagree with Tepper&amp;rsquo;s narrative of recent economic developments, but I suspect there is more to the story.</description>

      <title>Tools for thought = mental bureaucracy?</title>
      <link>https://relaxed-wilson-de5218.netlify.app/post/tools-for-thought-mental-bureaucracy/</link>

      <guid>https://relaxed-wilson-de5218.netlify.app/post/tools-for-thought-mental-bureaucracy/</guid>
      <description>*This is a hot take, quite happy to be disagreed with and told why I&amp;rsquo;m wrong*
I think focusing on using tools for thought can easily turn into the construction of a suffocating educational bureaucracy. It’s utopian high-modernism applied to independent learning.
What if it’s better to just learn things that really makes us burn with curiosity and desire, that make us want to keep building on that foundation and go deeper. The subject matter itself, in combination with our lifestyles (work, or random observations) should provide plenty of motivation for us to keep digging - such that we naturally reinforce our learning without needing to plan or systematize the necessary reinforcement.</description>

      <title>Toni Morrison’s &#34;Sula&#34; &amp; playing with meaning</title>

      <description>This was my first Toni Morrison book, and it was magnificent. It is clear as you read it that a master is at work. You feel you are in the palm of her hand, and you like it that way.
Horrifying and painful yet life-affirming all at once. Dramatic but in a playful, deft way. Compassionate but not pitying. Pensive but not preachy or judgmental. Especially on this last note - this novel brought back to mind David Chapman’s schematic of predominant stances toward meaning. I think the lens of this schematic helped me to more deeply appreciate the novel. The intertwining of Nel and Sula’s lives is in a way the interplay of eternalist and nihilist-ish philosophies.</description>
