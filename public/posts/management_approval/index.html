<p>One of my favorite wide-ranging writers, Alex Danco, wrote recently about how much of his new job at Shopify is to figure how the company&rsquo;s founders think, so that he can be persuasive and get stuff done. Roiling in existential crisis, I read it as a potentially useful datapoint on what useful work in the tech world for a generalist looks like.</p>
<p>Danco&rsquo;s reflection resonated deeply with my experience working at companies both small and large. In fact, it spoke exactly what I hated about those jobs! It surprised that anyone could speak fondly, even neutrally, about this kind of thing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like our ideas/work/products to be recognized for their usefulness to customers (i.e., merit), not for how well we were able to fit them or mold them to be amenable to the worldview of someone who isn’t even the customer. Ideally, you&rsquo;d hope that there&rsquo;d be overlap between the two&hellip;but when there isn&rsquo;t, it just sucks. I couldn&rsquo;t accept that my job was basically to persuade one person who doesn&rsquo;t actually speak for the customer or the mission.</p>
<p>And in companies with shitty cultures, what Danco describes quickly mutates into telling people what they want to hear. Making a great product with soul in the game, let alone serving the customer, disappears. It was hard to feel like an autonomous, independent producer - let alone human! - in this situation.</p>
<p>Plus, work like Danco describes seems like a rather modern phenomenon - at least at such scale. As Tanner Greer suggests, this practice of “trying to win management’s approval” has not always been the end goal of work.</p>
<p>I don’t think this is a matter of personality - or at least only a matter of personality. There are of course many important things that can be accomplished in groups - especially, large groups. Which necessitates exactly this kind of thing that Alex talks about.</p>
<p>Yet, I think before people will appreciate, respect, or even tolerate this process, I think they need to have had some experience of being autonomous producers ourselves, accountable only to themselves and to the marketplace. Having explored and honored this independent, visionary part of themselves, they can get to work persuading management without resentment. Having played the role of management before - even if in a smaller scale - they have a greater appreciation for the challenges of being the decision-maker. They can empathize and thus be more helpful. They may even make the choice that, having been in the DM role before and knowing stress it can bring, they’d prefer a lesser role, so that they can free up bandwidth for other activities.</p>
<p>I think many find themselves in roles where there job is to persuade management before they’ve gotten to play the role of autonomous producer/decision-maker. And are confused when they absolutely hate their lives.</p>
<p>In short, everybody should start a company. Torenburg advice.</p>
